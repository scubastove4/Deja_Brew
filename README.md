## **_Description_**

## ![Random Beer Pic](https://external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fg.foolcdn.com%2Feditorial%2Fimages%2F492714%2Fbeer-on-a-table.jpg&f=1&nofb=1)

Déjà Brew is the second project I completed as a student in the General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program. This project is a MERN application that was completed over the course of a week.

Déjà Brew is a public beer review app. Users can search by beer type or beer name. When reviewing each beer, users have the option to rate from 0-5, and leave a comment. Déjà Brew also has a neat random beer feature for those who like to try any and every beer, just click on the link and a beer from the database will pop up.

## **_App Overview_**

The homepage is where you start your search for that sudsy goodness. If you're not sure what you want exactly but have an idea of what style of beer you'd like, use the search bar to see some options in your style of choice. If you're pretty sure what you'd like but want to see what others think of it first, search the beer name and click the coaster to see reviews.

The navbar up top links to a Beer by Type page that is a little more broad, so you can see a whole bunch of styles. Clicking on an individual style will provide a list of beers in that category. If you're up for anything, there's also a random beer generator that will give a suggestion from our database!
